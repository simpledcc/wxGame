## Baseline facts

- Cocos project: `cocos-client/`
- Cocos target version: `3.8.8`
- Orientation: `portrait`
- Design resolution: `640x960`
- Runtime shell: persistent `Home.scene` plus route builders
- Phone runtime: `BASELINE_ACCEPTED` (confirmed by user/current project baseline)
- Creator/WeChat DevTools in this task: `NOT_REQUIRED`
- Legacy upload client: `miniprogram/`, untouched by G0

## File ownership

### Owned by this Goal

- `COCOS_PRE_GAME_FOUNDATION_TARGET_TASK.md`
- `COCOS_PRE_GAME_FOUNDATION_PROGRESS.md`
- Home/pre-game portions of `cocos-client/assets/scripts/components/ui/RuntimeScreenFactory.ts`
- `cocos-client/assets/scripts/scenes/HomeScene.ts`
- Reusable pre-game UI components under `cocos-client/assets/scripts/components/ui/`
- Home-related semantic theme tokens and resource slots, after checking shared use
- Tests directly covering the runtime Home shell and pre-game controls

### Shared, integration review required

- `cocos-client/assets/scripts/store/GameStore.ts`
- `cocos-client/assets/scripts/core/SceneRouter.ts`
- `cocos-client/assets/scripts/core/App.ts`
- `cocos-client/assets/scripts/themes/**`
- Cocos scenes, Bundle root meta, build settings and build pipeline tools

### Not owned / do not modify in this Goal

- `cocos-client/assets/bundles/mode_pk/**`
- `cocos-client/assets/bundles/mode_spell/**`
- `cloudfunctions/**`
- `miniprogram/**`
- Room, scoring, synchronization and cloud request/response contracts
- AppID, cloud environment, database permissions and upload configuration

## Stage status

| Stage | Status | Evidence | Blocking |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| G0 Baseline, ownership and progress | `DONE` | Branch/ownership recorded; full verify and build dry-run pass | None |
| G1 Shared visual foundation | `DONE` | Tokens, primitives, geometry/EditBox fixes and dedicated runtime test pass | None |
| G2 Home resource slots and style skeleton | `NOT_STARTED` | Next action defined below | None |
| G3 Real Home layout | `NOT_STARTED` |  | Depends on G1/G2 |
| G4 Interaction and real data binding | `NOT_STARTED` |  | Depends on G3 |
| G5 Code verification and handoff | `NOT_STARTED` |  | Depends on G1-G4 |

## G0 work completed

1. Published the master plan and current Goal document to `develop/cocos-migration` at base commit `387121a`.
2. Created the dedicated branch `feature/pre-game-ui-home-goal` so other computers and gameplay developers do not share a writable branch.
3. Confirmed the current code is already portrait `640x960`; no second resolution migration is needed.
4. Confirmed Home uses the persistent runtime shell and existing Store/Router/Theme boundaries.
5. Confirmed the current project has no formal Settings route; G1-G4 must prefer a minimal settings modal or an agreed integration contract.
6. Reproduced the cross-platform `test:spell-data` failure caused by hashing raw CRLF/LF bytes.
7. Canonicalized the generator and test to hash UTF-8 source with LF line endings while preserving all word/template data.
8. Regenerated the derived data and proved all 44 banks/6,351 templates still decode exactly.

## G1 work completed

1. Added 12 semantic Home color tokens to both committed theme manifests and the TypeScript catalog.
2. Added `PreGameUi`, a direct `640x960` design-space foundation that does not pass new Home layouts through the legacy landscape adapter.
3. Added reusable safe area, top bar, card, action button, icon button, label and input-blocking modal primitives.
4. Added stable icon slots and text fallbacks so G2 can replace art without changing button behavior or routes.
5. Fixed `RuntimeButtonVisual` to use the scaled dimensions and corner radius of its owning `UITransform`.
6. Added visual-geometry introspection used by runtime tests to prove visible and touch bounds remain equal in normal, pressed and disabled states.
7. Split `RuntimeUi.edit()` into an EditBox host plus a child Graphics background, removing the same-node renderable conflict.
8. Added a dedicated runtime-mock test covering safe-area dimensions, top-bar placement, card geometry, action/icon controls, modal input blocking, legacy button compatibility and EditBox layering.
9. Added static source checks, Cocos structure requirements and the new test to the full `npm run verify` chain.
10. Kept the final Home layout, settings behavior and all gameplay Bundle code untouched.

## G0 modified files

- `cocos-client/tools/generate-word-bank-data.js`
  - Canonicalizes CRLF/CR to LF before SHA-256 generation.
- `cocos-client/tools/test-spell-template-data.ts`
  - Uses the same canonical source representation during stale-data verification.
- `COCOS_PRE_GAME_FOUNDATION_PROGRESS.md`
  - Records G0 evidence, ownership, risks and the next action.

No generated word/template payload changed after regeneration.

## Tests

### Initial baseline

- `npm run verify`: `FAILED` only at `test:spell-data`.
- Failure: generated canonical LF hash `7e0714...` was compared with the Windows CRLF raw-byte hash `eae2f1...`.
- Checks before that point passed: structure, platform, lifecycle, cloud contracts, build pipeline and performance.

### After G0 fix

- `npm run generate:word-banks`: `PASSED`
- `npm run test:spell-data`: `PASSED` (44 banks, 6,351 templates, 240-item payload cap)
- `npm run verify`: `PASSED`
- `npm run build:wechat:dry-run`: `PASSED`
- `npm audit --omit=dev`: `PASSED`, 0 vulnerabilities
- `git diff --check`: required before the G0 commit

### G1 verification

- `npm run test:pre-game-ui`: `PASSED`
- `npm run test:phase8`: `PASSED`
- `npm run test:shell`: `PASSED`
- `npm run test:shell-runtime`: `PASSED`
- `npm run test:release`: `PASSED`
- `npm run typecheck`: `PASSED`
- `npm run typecheck:shell-runtime`: `PASSED`
- `npm run verify`: `PASSED` (includes the new G1 test)
- `npm audit --omit=dev`: `PASSED`, 0 vulnerabilities
- Structure contract: `122` required files checked
- Source payload: `1,494,938` bytes under the `1,500,000`-byte gate
- Cocos metadata: `113` files / `22,331` bytes

Creator import, WeChat DevTools, QR code, phone screenshots and upload are `NOT_REQUIRED` for this local code stage.

## Assets

- Added runtime assets: none
- Added reference assets: none
- Missing final assets: transparent Logo, safe avatar, Home background, character decoration and unified Home icon set
- G0/G1 use no reference image in the Cocos runtime package
- Future asset ownership: Home/common assets belong to the pre-game UI stream; gameplay assets remain in their mode bundles

## Known risks for G2

1. The Home reference requests a Settings button, while the current app has only `SettingsStore` and no route.
2. Home is currently assembled inside a large `RuntimeScreenFactory`; extracting a focused Home builder is allowed only when it reduces ownership conflicts without changing routes.
3. The static source-payload gate has only `5,062` bytes of remaining room. G2 must avoid putting design references in `assets/` and may need an approved budget/packaging adjustment before adding runtime art.
4. No final Logo, safe avatar, Home background, character decoration or unified icon set exists yet.
5. Other developers may change gameplay bundles concurrently; this branch must not reformat or move their files.

## Shared-file coordination

- G0 changed no shared application runtime files; its hash fix changes no generated gameplay data.
- G1 changed shared theme and UI primitives but did not change Store, Router, App, scenes, build settings or gameplay bundles.
- Theme JSON and TypeScript manifests remain field-for-field equal under `test:phase8`.
- `PreGameUi` is additive; the current Home builder does not use it until G3.
- Any required Store/Router change must be isolated and documented before implementation.

## Next single action

Execute only G2:

> Establish Home background, Logo/avatar/character/icon resource slots and a documented missing-asset manifest using existing assets or programmatic fallbacks. Keep reference composites out of runtime assets, respect the source budget, and do not implement the final Home layout or modify gameplay bundles.

Continue COCOS_PRE_GAME_FOUNDATION_TARGET_TASK.md on branch feature/pre-game-ui-home-goal.
Read COCOS_PRE_GAME_FOUNDATION_PROGRESS.md and inspect remote changes first.
G0 and G1 are complete; execute only G2. Do not modify mode_pk, mode_spell, cloudfunctions, miniprogram, room/scoring/cloud contracts, AppID or cloud environment.
Run the G2 tests, update this progress file, commit and push the stage before stopping.
